      Most likely, **your login is being throttled**. This can happen if you have too many failed login
      attempts. Wait **one** hour, [reset your password](https://account.mojang.com/password), then try logging
      into Minecraft.

      If that doesn't work, comeback here and select "No" when you answer this question.

      If you are only able to play demo mode after purchasing the game, the most likely cause is that **you have logged
      into the wrong Mojang account**. Check your email address for any misspellings, and try again.

      Other causes include:

        1. **Forgetting to set a profile name** ([you can do so here](https://account.mojang.com/me))
        2. **Forgetting to migrate your old Minecraft.net account**
       ([click here for help with migration](https://help.mojang.com/customer/portal/articles/438361))

      For more information on how to fix this problem, please see this

      fix your account.
