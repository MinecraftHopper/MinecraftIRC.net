<p>This error is caused when the registry contains malformed information involving the current Java installation. In
	most cases, reinstalling the proper version of Java should solve this, otherwise, you should get a registry cleaner to
	scan your computer.</p>
<h4>Reinstalling Java</h4>
<p>Minecraft, runs on a platform called Java. Java comes in many shapes, and forms, which may make it confusing exactly
	which version of it you should have installed, which is what this should hopefully explain.</p>
<p>First, we want to find out our OS's processor architecture.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If you are on Windows -</strong>&nbsp;Press your&nbsp;Windows + R&nbsp;keys, to bring up a run dialogue, in it, type in:
	"<strong>cmd</strong>", and hit enter. This will bring up a command prompt window. In the window, type in:
	<code>echo %processor_architecture%</code> then hit enter.&nbsp;<br>If the output was <strong>amd64</strong>, you have a
	<strong>64-bit OS</strong>. If the output was <strong>x86</strong>, you have a <strong>32-bit OS</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>If you are on Mac OSX -</strong> You have a 64-bit OS, all good!</p>
<p><strong>If you are on Linux - </strong>Type this command in a terminal window:&nbsp; <code>less /proc/cpuinfo</code>.</p>
<p>Now that we have that, &nbsp;look at the diagram below, and download the proper Java version for your OS and processor
	architecture. If you are prompted that said version of Java is already installed, please uninstall your current
	version of Java and redo this step.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once you have installed the proper Java version, you should give the game a go!</p>
