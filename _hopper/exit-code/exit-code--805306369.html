<h2>Exit Code:&nbsp;-805306369</h2>
<hr>
<p>This exit code is caused when the client runs out of memory.</p>
<p>This can be caused by the JVM not being allocated enough memory, a bug in the game, using client modifications or a
	dependency of the game that has unexpectedly terminated.</p>
<h4>How to fix this</h4>
<ul>
	<li>See <a href="/help/out-of-memory">this article</a> on instructions to allocate more memory.</li>
