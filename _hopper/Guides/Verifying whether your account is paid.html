<h1>Verify Your Mojang Account Owns Minecraft</h1>
<p>This will allow you to make sure that the purchase was successful and that issues you are experiencing are with the
	game, not with your account.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Go to <span class="plugin_link"><a href="http://account.mojang.com/login">account.mojang.com/login</a></span>
		and log in. If you're still using your username instead of your email address to sign in, it's recommended that
		you <span class="plugin_link"><a href="https://account.mojang.com/migrate" target="_blank">migrate</a></span>
		your account.</li>
	<li>After logging in, you should see a list of games.<span class="plugin_picture align-left">

		</span></li>
	<li>If "Minecraft" is on this list, then you have purchased the game using this account, if you <strong>do not see
			Minecraft,</strong> then you <strong>have not purchased Minecraft</strong> using <em>this</em> account. Try
		logging in with other email addresses, it's possible that you accidentally created more than one Mojang account.
