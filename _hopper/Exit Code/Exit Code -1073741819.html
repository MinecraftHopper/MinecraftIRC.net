<hr>
<p>We are currently investigating the root cause of this issue. In order to solve this issue, some known workarounds
	include reinstalling the JVM or updating your graphics drivers, this error may also be caused by <a
		href="../code-1073740777">having "D3Dgear" installed</a>.</p>
<h3>How to fix this</h3>
<p>Due to the quite vagueness of the error, we are unsure of the exact cause. Please try the following and attempt to
	see it they solve your case:</p>
<ul>
	<li>This may possibly be caused by having D3Dgear installed. (If that is the case, please <a

	<li>Try reinstalling Java</li>

<h4>Reinstalling Java</h4>
<p>Minecraft, runs on a platform called Java. Java comes in many shapes, and forms, which may make it confusing exactly
	which version of it you should have installed, which is what this should hopefully explain.</p>
<p>First, we want to find out our OS's processor architecture. </p>
<p><strong>If you are on Windows -</strong> Press your Windows + R keys, to bring up a run dialogue, in it, type in:
	"<strong>cmd</strong>", and hit enter. This will bring up a command prompt window. In the window, type in:
	<code>echo %processor_architecture%</code> then hit enter. <br>If the output was <strong>amd64</strong>, you have a
	<strong>64-bit OS</strong>. If the output was <strong>x86</strong>, you have a <strong>32-bit OS</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>If you are on Mac OSX -</strong> You have a 64-bit OS, all good!</p>
<p><strong>If you are on Linux - </strong>Type this command in a terminal window:  <code>less /proc/cpuinfo</code>.</p>
<p>Now that we have that,  look at the diagram below, and download the proper Java version for your OS and processor
	architecture. If you are prompted that said version of Java is already installed, please uninstall your current
	version of Java and redo this step. </p>

<p>Once you have installed the proper Java version, you should give the game a go!</p>
