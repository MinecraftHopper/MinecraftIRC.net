		<p>This error occurs when the game does not have enough memory, or RAM, to continue.</p>
		<p>RAM stands for "Random Access Memory", which is a vital part of your computer. Your computer will not
			function without it. It is installed on the computer's motherboard, storing data immediately needed for the
			computer to function. Minecraft requires at least <strong>384MB</strong> of RAM to function, however
			Minecraft will usually take up more than 1GB of memory to save information for blocks, players, mobs and
			many other things. When Minecraft cannot allocate (get) more RAM from the computer due to not enough RAM
			installed or too many other processes using up RAM (such as other games, web browsers and applications), it
			crashes with the <strong>Out of Memory</strong> error.</p>
		<p>Firstly, you should close every other applications to see if the problem goes away (some web browsers such as
			Chrome can take up lots of memory if you open a lot of tabs). If not, follow the instructions below.</p>

							<p>In order to troubleshoot this error, you must first find out how much RAM you have
								available on your computer.</p>
							<p>Depending on your operating system, these instructions will vary.</p>
							<p><strong>If you are on Windows - </strong>Press your <em>Windows + R</em> keys, to bring
								up a run dialogue, in it, type in: "<strong>cmd</strong>", and hit enter. This will
								bring up a command prompt window. In the Command Prompt window, type in:&nbsp;
								<code>systeminfo | find "Total Physical Memory".</code>&nbsp;Once you have done so, give it a
								minute to gather the info, and you should be presented with a number in megabytes, which
								you will need for later.</p>
							<p><strong>If you are on Mac OSX -</strong>&nbsp;Apple has made a tutorial which explains how to
								check the amount of system memory available which can be found <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1342">here</a>.</p>
							<p><strong>If you are on Linux - </strong>Open a terminal window, and type in: <em>free</em>
							</p>
							<p>Once you have found the amount of RAM on your PC, you can continue.</p>

							<p>Minecraft runs on a platform called Java. Java is by nature multi-platform and releases
								different versions for each platform and for each type of processor architecture, which
								may make it confusing exactly which version of it you should have installed, which is
								what this should hopefully explain.</p>
							<p><strong>Note that if you are using the latest launcher from Mojang dubbed the "native
									launcher," you will automatically have the latest prefered Java installation on your
									computer. For Windows users, you can download the latest launcher at
									https://minecraft.net/download. For OS X users, you will have to wait until later
									this year (2015) to get the new launcher.</strong></p>
							<p><strong><em>If you are using the native launcher, skip to the "Still not working"
										section.</em></strong></p>
							<p>First, we want to find out our OS's processor architecture.&nbsp;</p>
							<p><strong>If you are on Windows -</strong>&nbsp;Press your&nbsp;Windows + R&nbsp;keys, to bring up a run
								dialogue, in it, type in: "<strong>cmd</strong>", and hit enter. This will bring up a
								command prompt window. In the window, type in:
								<code>echo %processor_architecture%</code> then hit enter.&nbsp;If the output was
								<strong>amd64</strong>, you have a <strong>64-bit OS</strong>. If the output was
								<strong>x86</strong>, you have a <strong>32-bit OS</strong>.</p>
							<p><strong>If you are on Mac OSX -</strong> You have a 64-bit OS. If you're running OS X
								10.6.8 and below, stop here and use &nbsp;to update Java instead. Otherwise, you can
								continue.</p>
							<p><strong>If you are on Linux - </strong>Type this command in a terminal window:&nbsp;
								<code>less /proc/cpuinfo</code>.</p>
							<p>Now that we have that, look at the diagram below and download the proper Java version for
								your OS and processor architecture. If you are prompted that said version of Java is
								already installed, please uninstall your current version of Java before continuing.&nbsp;</p>

							<p>Once you have checked the amount of memory available on your computer and have also
								checked to make sure you are using a proper Java installation, you may need to allocate
								more memory to Minecraft.</p>
							<p>Before you allocate more memory to Minecraft, you should close any excess programs on
								your computer that you may not be using, for example Google Chrome browser tabs or other
								games.</p>
							<p>Allocating more memory</p>
							<p>Once you have done the above, and you continue to receive out of memory errors despite
								having enough memory, then you may need to manually give the game more
								memory<strong>*</strong>.&nbsp;To approach, you previously collected the amount of memory you
								have. Now, to allocate memory to the game, pick an amount of RAM that is more than
								1024MB or 1G, but less than the total amount of RAM you have on your computer. For
								example, "2048MB" or "2G".<br>If you need to convert between MB and GB, remember that
								<strong>1GB = 1024MB</strong>.</p>
							<p><em>* NOTE: On 32-bit Windows Java installations, you can only allocate up to
									<strong>1.5G</strong> of RAM!&nbsp;</em></p>
							<p>To allocate more RAM, open the game launcher, and press the "Edit Profile" button at the
								bottom left. There should be a checkbox called "JVM arguments", check that and input:
								<code>-Xmx2G</code> to give 2GB to the game, or <code>-Xmx2560M</code> to give 2560MB.
								Once you have checked and inputted the data, hit "Save Profile".</p>
							<p>Once you have done so, try the game again!</p>
