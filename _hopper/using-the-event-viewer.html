<h1>Checking the Event Log</h1>
<p>If you are on a Windows OS, and you are getting strange undocumented errors, it may be helpful to check the Event
	log. "Event Viewer" is a utility that comes with Windows which as the name suggests, logs various operations on your
	computer, from notifications to errors.</p>
<h3>How to open Event Viewer</h3>
<p>To open Event Viewer, on any windows OS, press both your Windows and R keys together to bring up a 'Run' dialogue.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>In the box, type in: "<strong>eventvwr</strong>" and press Enter or hit OK.</p>
<h3>How to use Event Viewer</h3>
<p>Once you have opened Event Viewer, you will get a branch menu at the right, that looks like this:</p><img src="/static/images/hopper/using-the-event-viewer-1.png">

			get a list of events as such:</p><img src="/static/images/hopper/using-the-event-viewer-2.png">
