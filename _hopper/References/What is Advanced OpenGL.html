		<h1>Advanced OpenGL in Minecraft</h1>
		<br>
		<p>Advanced OpenGL, is a toggle which can be found in the Video settings section of the Minecraft options
			screen.</p>

	<h2 style="font-weight: normal;">What does Advanced OpenGL do?</h2>
	<br>
	<p>Advanced OpenGL makes use of “occlusion culling”. In simpler terms this means that your game will not render
		anything that is not directly in view of the player. The game still “knows” where everything is, but they are
		simply not being processed.</p>
	<p>This setting is of great help to users with low-end graphics cards (GPUs) as it reduces their load. However, in
		exchange for this your processor (CPU) must do some extra work in order to figure this all out.</p>
	<p>This is exceptionally useful for users playing Minecraft on a laptop. Average laptops tend to have (very) low-end
		graphical capabilities but decent processors. A good example of this would be a relatively new laptop with an
		Intel i3 or i5 processor but integrated graphics.</p>

	<h2 style="font-weight: normal;">Should I use Advanced OpenGL?</h2>
	<br>
	<p>Enabling Advanced OpenGL may help many laptop users by allowing their powerful CPUs to ease the load on their
		non-gaming graphics cards.</p>
	<p>This can frequently mean that having Advanced OpenGL turned on causes a decent increase in FPS and stability of
		Minecraft.</p>
	<p>However, Advanced OpenGL is a double edge setting. You may expect that it would increase FPS for all users, but
		that isn’t the case. At certain occasions, it actually decreases the frame rate that their computers would
		normally achieve.</p>
	<p>As such, there is no definite answer to whether your computer will run smoother if this feature is enabled. To
		get the best performance, check which setting works best for you.</p>
