<h1>Modded Minecraft</h1>
<blockquote>This page is for dealing with crashes due to running a version of Minecraft that was not produced by Mojang.
	These versions are often called "mods" (short for modification) and are not under Mojang's control, but we can help
	you fix crashes.</blockquote>
<h3>How to fix the problem</h3>
<li>
	<h4>Option 1: Go clean</h4>
</li>
<blockquote>Remove mods and use a Mojang-supplied version of Minecraft <strong>(YOU WILL LOSE ANYTHING THAT IS PART OF
		THE MODS AND WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CONNECT TO SERVERS WITH THE MOD)</strong>.</blockquote>
<ol>
	<li>Open the Launcher.</li>
	<li>Click "New Profile" in the upper right-hand corner.</li>
	<li>Change all the settings you want, but leave "Use Version" set to "Use Latest Version".</li>
	<li>Click "Save Profile".</li>
	<li>Run the launcher with the newly created profile selected in the upper right-hand corner.</li>
</ol>
<li>
	<h4>Option 2: Revert</h4>
</li>
<blockquote>Use an earlier version of the mod that worked <strong>(YOU WILL LOSE ANYTHING ADDED IN A LATER VERSION OF
		THE MOD AND WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CONNECT TO SERVERS USING NEWER VERSIONS OF THE MOD)</strong>.</blockquote>
<ol>
	<li>Open your .minecraft folder.</li>
	<li>Open the folder "Versions".</li>
	<li>Open the folder of the modded version you are using.</li>
	<li>Replace the [VERSIONNAMEHERE].jar with an older .jar file that worked.</li>
</ol>
<li>
	<h4>Option 3: Update</h4>
</li>
<blockquote>Update the mod to a newer version that may have fixed the bug <strong>(YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CONNECT TO
		SERVERS USING OLDER VERSIONS OF THE MOD)</strong>.</blockquote>
<ol>
	<li>Open your .minecraft folder.</li>
	<li>Open the folder "Versions".</li>
	<li>Open the folder of the modded version you are using.</li>
	<li>Replace the [VERSIONNAMEHERE].jar with an newer .jar file of the mod.</li>
</ol>
<li>
	<h4>Option 4: Ask for help</h4>
</li>
<blockquote>Contact the creators of the mod or others who use the mod and ask them for help.</blockquote>
