<h1>Failed to unpack natives: Socket read timed out</h1>
<p>This error is caused when certain files fail to properly download, and are incorrectly "skipped" by the launcher,
	believing that the file already exists, while it in reality does not.</p>
<p>This in return, gives an error when the game tries to open a couple of files, and it actually realizes that the file
	does not exist, returning the <em>java.util.zip.ZipException: error in opening zip file</em> exception.</p>

			<h4 id="firewall"><em class="icon-file"></em> Faulty antivirus and or firewall</h4>

			<p>Antiviruses and firewalls block some applications from connecting to the internet to prevent the computer
				from being infected with malware. However, this behaviour is sometimes too intrusive and may cause
				non-malware to get blocked too.</p>

				<h4 id="malware"><em class="icon-folder-open"></em> Malware</h4>

				<p>Certain malware are known to cause errors when applications try to connect to external sites.</p>

			<h4 id="latency"><em class="icon-hdd"></em> Latency to servers</h4>

			<p>If your internet connection is too slow, Minecraft may fail to download some files because the download
				took too long and the system thought the connection was lost.</p>

	<h2 id="firewalls-and-antiviruses"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Firewalls and antiviruses</span></h2>

	<p>Certain <strong>firewalls and antiviruses</strong> are known to have issues with Minecraft.</p>

	<p>It is recommended that you un-install them, if you are using one.</p>

	<p>You can check what AntiVirus you are using by holding the Windows key, then pressing “R”.</p>

	<p>In the Run dialogue, type in “<strong>appwiz.cpl</strong>” and press OK.</p>

	<p>Search for anything that has “<em>Security</em>“, “<em>Firewall</em>“, or “<em>Antivirus</em>” as a keyword, and
		you should be able to pinpoint the antivirus or firewall application that you are using, and also un-install it.
