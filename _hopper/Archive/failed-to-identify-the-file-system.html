	<h1>Failed to identify the file system</h1>
	<p><br>This error is usually caused by a problem with your system and isn't related to the game itself.</p>
	<p>If you are receiving this error, you should check your hard drive for errors.</p>

	<legend>The file or directory is corrupted and unreadable<small class="pull-right"><a href="#1" style="text-decoration: none; color: grey;" id="1">#1</a></small></legend>
	<p>This error is caused when the game tries to modify a file on the system, but failed to do so as the system it's
		self reports that the operation failed, as hence the name of the errorâ€”is corrupt and unreadable.</p>
	<p>As such, the error is not due to the actual game, rather the system it's self, making there no actual "fix". It
		is advisable that you run a Hard Disk scan, to check for possible errors pertaining to the error.</p>
	<p>For further assistance, please contact a local computer professional to help troubleshoot Hard Disk issues.</p>

		not result in being required to be reformatted.&nbsp;</p>
