<h3>What is a DxDiag?</h3>
<p>DxDiag stands for "DirectX Diagnostics". It is a diagnostics tool that is commonly used to collect information about
	your processor, RAM, and video card. &nbsp;This information is very helpful in determining the issue with your computer
	and a possible solution to your problem.</p>
<h3>How to collect a DxDiag:</h3>
<p>There are two different methods for retrieving this information. The first method is the most common, but sometimes
	there are issues if the drivers are completely broken or missing.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 5px;">3.&nbsp;</span>If this is your first time running DxDiag, a window will pop up asking if
	you want the drivers to be digitally signed. This means that Windows will check to see if the drivers are from a
	valid manufacturer and have not been tampered with. It is recommended that you select "yes". However, it requires an
	internet connection. If you do not have an internet connection, select "no".</p>
