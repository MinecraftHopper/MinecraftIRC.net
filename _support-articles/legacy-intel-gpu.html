<p>Some Intel chipsets in the <strong>Intel 4 Series</strong>, most notably the <strong>Intel 965 Express Chipset</strong> are known to have issues with OpenGL support, causing newer versions of Minecraft to not run.
    (A full list of affected devices can be found <a href="http://downloadmirror.intel.com/18223/eng/relnotes_win7_gfx.htm">here</a>.)</p>
<p>If you see a crash report that looks like this, it means your computer is affected:
    <code class="block">#  EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION (0xc0000005) at pc=*, pid=*, tid=*
#
# JRE version: Java™ SE Runtime Environment (7.0_51-b13) (build 1.7.0_51-b13)
# Java VM: Java HotSpot™ Client VM (* mixed mode, sharing windows-* )
# Problematic frame:
# C  [ig4dev32.dll+0x3e88]
OR
# C  [ig4dev64.dll+0x55ec]</code>
</p>

<p>
    This error currently only affects all versions past <strong>1.7.4</strong> - and will likely affect all future versions of Minecraft.
</p>
<p>As such, you may work around this error by playing a version prior to <strong>1.7.4</strong>, such as 1.7.2. To play <strong>1.7.4</strong> or later versions, you will need a new computer.</p>
<p>For desktop users, you can purchase and install a new GPU, but the fact that your computer has an Intel 965 Chipset means that your computer is likely to be very old, and a new computer may be more cost-efficient.</p>
