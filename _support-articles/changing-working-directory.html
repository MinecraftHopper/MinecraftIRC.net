<p>
    In some cases, you may need to completely change the root folder (the working directory) that Minecraft uses â€” this is now possible with the new launcher.
</p>


<h2>Windows</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Right click on <code>Minecraft.exe</code> or <code>Minecraft.jar</code> (the launcher) and press "Create Shortcut".</li>
    <li>Right click on the new shortcut that gets generated and press "Properties".</li>
    <li>At the end of the 'Target' bar, add the following: <code>--workDir {the new working directory}</code>, such as <code>%ProgramData%\.minecraft</code><br>
        For example, if your new working directory is <code>%ProgramData%\.minecraft</code>, the window should look like this:
        <img class="block" src="/static/images/support-articles/workdir-windows.png">
    </li>
    <li>Press 'OK' and then run the shortcut, and Minecraft should launch.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you should ever need to move the actual <code>Minecraft.exe</code> file (not the shortcut), you will have to follow these instructions again.</p>

<h3>Mac OSX and Linux</h3>
<p>
    Create a terminal script that launches <code>Minecraft.jar</code> with the <code>--workDir</code> parameter, to a destination that does not contain special characters in it. For example:
    <code class="block">open ~/unsafe/path/to/Minecraft.jar --workDir {the new working directory}</code>
</p>
